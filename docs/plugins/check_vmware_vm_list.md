## Overview

Nagios plugin used to list Virtual Machines in order to test include/exclude
options.

This plugin provides a way to test the include/exclude options supported by
other plugins (e.g., Virtual Machine or Resource Pool name, power state).

## Output

The output for these plugins is designed to provide the one-line summary
needed by Nagios for quick identification of a problem while providing longer,
more detailed information for display within the web UI, use in email and
Teams notifications
([atc0005/send2teams](https://github.com/atc0005/send2teams)).

See the [main project README](../../README.md) for details.

## Performance Data

### Background

Initial support has been added for emitting Performance Data / Metrics, but
refinement suggestions are welcome.

Consult the list below for the metrics implemented thus far, [the original
discussion thread](https://github.com/atc0005/check-vmware/discussions/315)
and the [Add Performance Data / Metrics
support](https://github.com/atc0005/check-vmware/projects/1) project board for
an index of the initial implementation work.

Please add to an existing
[Discussion](https://github.com/atc0005/check-vmware/discussions) thread or
[open a new one](https://github.com/atc0005/check-vmware/discussions/new) with
any feedback that you may have. Thanks in advance!

### Supported metrics

- `time`
- `vms`
- `vms_after_filtering`
- `vms_powered_on`
- `vms_powered_off`
- `vms_excluded_by_name`
- `vms_excluded_by_power_state`
- `resource_pools_excluded`
- `resource_pools_included`
- `resource_pools_evaluated`

TODO:

- `folders_included` (GH-809)
  - folder MOID values specified on CLI
- `folders_excluded` (GH-809)
  - folder MOID values specified on CLI

## Optional evaluation

Some plugins provide optional support to limit evaluation of VMs to specific
Resource Pools (explicitly including or excluding) and power states (on or
off). Other plugins support similar filtering options (e.g., `Acknowledged`
state of Triggered Alarms). See the [configuration
options](#configuration-options), [examples](#examples) and
[contrib](#contrib) sections for more information.

## Installation

See the [main project README](../../README.md) for details.

## Configuration options

### Threshold calculations

None. If execution is successful the plugin returns output and exits with an
`OK` state.

If execution fails (e.g., timeout, invalid CLI flags or values) then an
appropriate exit code and error output will be returned.

### Command-line arguments

- Use the `-h` or `--help` flag to display current usage information.
- Flags marked as **`required`** must be set via CLI flag.
- Flags *not* marked as required are for settings where a useful default is
  already defined, but may be overridden if desired.

| Flag              | Required | Default | Repeat | Possible                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Configuration file

Not currently supported. This feature may be added later if there is
sufficient interest.

## Contrib

See the [main project README](../../README.md) for details.

## Examples

### CLI invocation

```ShellSession
/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_vmware_vm_list --domain example.com --username SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME --password "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD" --server vc1.example.com --powered-off --trust-cert --log-level info
```

See the [configuration options](#configuration-options) section for all
command-line settings supported by this plugin along with descriptions of
each. See the [contrib](#contrib) section for information regarding example
command definitions and Nagios configuration files.

Of note:

- Certificate warnings are ignored.
  - not best practice, but many vCenter instances use self-signed certs per
    various freely available guides
- Service Check results output is sent to `stdout`
- Logging output is enabled at the `info` level.
  - logging output is sent to `stderr` by default
  - logging output is intended to be seen when invoking the plugin directly
    via CLI (often for troubleshooting)
    - see the [Output section](../../README.md#output) of the main README for
      potential conflicts with some monitoring systems

### Command definition

```shell
# /etc/nagios-plugins/config/vmware-vm-list.cfg

# Look at all pools, all VMs regardless of power state.
define command{
    command_name    check_vmware_vm_list
    command_line    $USER1$/check_vmware_vm_list --server '$HOSTNAME$' --domain '$ARG1$' --username '$ARG2$' --password '$ARG3$' --powered-off  --trust-cert --log-level info
    }
```
