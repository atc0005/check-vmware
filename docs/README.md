# [check-vmware][repo-url] | Docs

[HOME: Main project README](../README.md)

At present, documentation is split between several sources:

- the [main project README](../README.md)
- plugin specific documentation in the `docs/plugins/` subdirectory path
- misc scratch notes (created early in this project's development) in the
  `docs/scratch/` subdirectory path

## Plugins

Documentation specific to each plugin resides here. See the [main project
README](../README.md) for general information not specific to any one plugin.

## Scratch

This a collection of random notes that I would normally keep on a private
branch, ticketing system, wiki, etc.

Some of these details I'll likely look back at for later refactoring or to
remind myself why a particular design choice was made. The intended audience
is mostly myself, though someone looking for more of the design backstory
might be interested in the content also.
