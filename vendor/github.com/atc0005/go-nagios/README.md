## Status

Alpha quality.

This codebase is subject to change without notice and may break client code
that depends on it. You are encouraged to [vendor](#references) this package
if you find it useful until such time that the API is considered stable.

## Overview

This package contains common types and package-level variables used when
developing Nagios plugins. The intent is to reduce code duplication between
various plugins and help reduce typos associated with literal strings.

## Features

- Nagios state constants
  - state labels (e.g., `StateOKLabel`)
  - state exit codes (e.g., `StateOKExitCode`)
- `ExitState` type with `ReturnCheckResults` and `AddPerfData` methods
  - used to process and return all applicable check results to Nagios for
    further processing/display
  - supports "branding" callback function to display application name,
    version, or other information as a "trailer" for check results provided to
    Nagios
    - this could be useful for identifying what version of a plugin determined
      the service or host state to be an issue
  - captures panics from client code
    - surfaces these panics as `CRITICAL` state and overrides service output
      and error details to make any panics prominent
  - optional support for emitting performance data generated by plugins
    - NOTE: The implementation of this support is not yet stable and is
      expected to change in the near future. See GH-81 and GH-92 for
      additional details.

## Changelog

See the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file for the changes associated with
each release of this application. Changes that have been merged to `master`,
but not yet an official release may also be noted in the file under the
`Unreleased` section. A helpful link to the Git commit history since the last
official release is also provided for further review.

## Examples

### Use only the provided constants

Assuming that you're using [Go
Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules), add this line to your
imports like so:

```golang
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"

  "github.com/atc0005/go-nagios"
)
  ```

Then in your code, reference the data types as you would from any other
package:

```golang
fmt.Println("OK: All checks have passed")
os.Exit(nagios.StateOKExitCode)
```

Alternatively, you can also use the provided state "labels" (constants) to
avoid using literal string state values:

```golang
fmt.Printf("%s: All checks have passed\r\n", nagios.StateOKLabel)
os.Exit(nagios.StateOKExitCode)
```

When you next build your package this one should be pulled in.

### Use `ReturnCheckResults` method

Assuming that you're using [Go
Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules), add this line to your
imports like so:

```golang
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"

  "github.com/atc0005/go-nagios"
)
```

then in your code, create an instance of `ExitState` and immediately defer
`ReturnCheckResults()`. If you don't, any other deferred functions *will not
run*.

Here we're optimistic and we are going to note that all went well.

```golang

    var nagiosExitState = nagios.ExitState{
        LastError:         nil,
        ExitStatusCode:    nagios.StateOKExitCode,
    }

    defer nagiosExitState.ReturnCheckResults()

    // more stuff here

    nagiosExitState.ServiceOutput = certs.OneLineCheckSummary(
        nagios.StateOKLabel,
        certChain,
        certsSummary.Summary,
    )

    nagiosExitState.LongServiceOutput := certs.GenerateCertsReport(
        certChain,
        certsExpireAgeCritical,
        certsExpireAgeWarning,
    )

```

For handling error cases, the approach is roughly the same, only you call
`return` explicitly to end execution of the client code and allow deferred
functions to run.

### Use `ReturnCheckResults` method with a branding callback

Assuming that you're using [Go
Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules), add this line to your
imports like so:

```golang
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"
  "strings"

  "github.com/atc0005/go-nagios"
)
```

then in this example, we'll make a further assumption that you have a `config`
value with an `EmitBranding` field to indicate whether the user/sysadmin has
opted to emit branding information.

```golang
func main() {

    var nagiosExitState = nagios.ExitState{
        LastError:         nil,
        ExitStatusCode:    nagios.StateOKExitCode,
    }

    defer nagiosExitState.ReturnCheckResults()

    // ...

    if config.EmitBranding {
      // If enabled, show application details at end of notification
      nagiosExitState.BrandingCallback = Branding("Notification generated by ")
    }

    // ...

}
```

the `Branding` function might look something like this:

```golang
// Branding accepts a message and returns a function that concatenates that
// message with version information. This function is intended to be called as
// a final step before application exit after any other output has already
// been emitted.
func Branding(msg string) func() string {
    return func() string {
        return strings.Join([]string{msg, Version()}, "")
    }
}
```

but you could just as easily create an anonymous function as the callback:

```golang
func main() {

    var nagiosExitState = nagios.ExitState{
        LastError:         nil,
        ExitStatusCode:    nagios.StateOKExitCode,
    }

    defer nagiosExitState.ReturnCheckResults()

    if config.EmitBranding {
        // If enabled, show application details at end of notification
        nagiosExitState.BrandingCallback = func(msg string) func() string {
            return func() string {
                return "Notification generated by " + msg
            }
        }("HelloWorld")
    }

    // ...

}
```

### Collect and emit Performance Data

TODO: Add content.

As of this writing, the implementation for emitting Performance Data hasn't
stabilized yet. See [GH-81](https://github.com/atc0005/go-nagios/issues/81)
for initial notes and linked repos/issues for further details. This entry
should be updated once the implementation is stable enough. See
[GH-92](https://github.com/atc0005/go-nagios/issues/92) for additional
information.
