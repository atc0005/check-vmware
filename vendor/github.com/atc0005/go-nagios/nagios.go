// ReturnCheckResults is intended to provide a reliable way to return a
// desired exit code from applications used as Nagios plugins. In most cases,
// this method should be registered as the first deferred function in client
// code. See remarks regarding "masking" or "swallowing" application panics.
//
// Since Nagios relies on plugin exit codes to determine success/failure of
// checks, the approach that is most often used with other languages is to use
// something like Using os.Exit() directly and force an early exit of the
// application with an explicit exit code. Using os.Exit() directly in Go does
// not run deferred functions. Go-based plugins that do not rely on deferring
// function calls may be able to use os.Exit(), but introducing new
// dependencies later could introduce problems if those dependencies rely on
// deferring functions.
//
// Before calling this method, client code should first set appropriate field
// values on the receiver. When called, this method will process them and exit
// with the desired exit code and status output.
//
// To repeat, if scheduled via defer, this method should be registered first;
// because this method calls os.Exit to set the intended plugin exit state, no
// other deferred functions will have an opportunity to run, so register this
// method first so that when deferred, it will be run last (FILO).
//
// Because this method is (or should be) deferred first within client code, it
// will run after all other deferred functions. It will also run before a
// panic in client code forces the application to exit. As already noted, this
// method calls os.Exit to set the plugin exit state. Because os.Exit forces
// the application to terminate immediately without running other deferred
// functions or processing panics, this "masks", "swallows" or "blocks" panics
// from client code from surfacing. This method checks for unhandled panics
// and if found, overrides exit state details from client code and surfaces
// details from the panic instead as a CRITICAL state.
