/*
Nagios plugin used to monitor the cumulative size of snapshots for each
Virtual Machine.

# PURPOSE

Monitor the **cumulative** size of snapshots for each Virtual Machine.

While individual snapshots are listed, it is the cumulative size for a Virtual
Machine crossing a given size threshold that determines the overall check
result.

The current design of this plugin is to evaluate *all* Virtual Machines,
whether powered off or powered on. If you have a use case for evaluating
*only* powered on VMs by default, please post it to
https://github.com/atc0005/check-vmware/discussions/177 providing some details
for your use-case.

The output for this plugin is designed to provide the one-line summary needed
by Nagios for quick identification of a problem while providing longer, more
detailed information for use in email and Teams notifications
(https://github.com/atc0005/send2teams).
