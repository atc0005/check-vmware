/*

Nagios plugin used to monitor datastore usage.

PURPOSE

In addition to reporting current datastore usage, this plugin also reports
which VMs reside on the datastore along with their percentage of the total
datastore space used.

The output for this plugin is designed to provide the one-line summary needed
by Nagios for quick identification of a problem while providing longer, more
detailed information for use in email and Teams notifications
(https://github.com/atc0005/send2teams).
