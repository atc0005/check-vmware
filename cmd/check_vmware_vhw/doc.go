/*
Nagios plugin used to monitor virtual hardware versions.

# PURPOSE

This plugin supports four monitoring modes:

 1. Homogeneous version check
 2. Minimum required version check
 3. Outdated-by or threshold range check
 4. Default is minimum required version check

The output for this plugin is designed to provide the one-line summary needed
by Nagios for quick identification of a problem while providing longer, more
detailed information for use in email and Teams notifications
(https://github.com/atc0005/send2teams).
